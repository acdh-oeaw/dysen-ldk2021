A review and cluster analysis of German polarity resources for sentiment analysis

This repository accompanies the LDK 2021 submission 'A review and cluster analysis of German polarity resources for sentiment analysis'.

If you make use of the code or other outputs from this research, please make sure to cite it accordingly: [PLACEHOLDER CITATION].

If you make any use of one of the individual sentiment resources, please also credit the original creators. We provided the accompanying papers in the 'papers' folder in this repository.

Please note that it is not the aim of the research project to create a flawless polarity resource for sentiment analysis (or any other purpose, to be honest). The heart of the research project is mapping out the landscape of German polarity resources. The  master dictionary is a mere side-product of the research process and is made available to the scientific community to encourage and facilitate further research in this area. 

During the pre-processing of the individual polarity resources all possible care was taken to identify and remove any entries containing typos, scrambled characters and other errors. Considering the sheer size of entries (> 400 000 ) there can be no guarantee, though, that some errors escaped our efforts.
